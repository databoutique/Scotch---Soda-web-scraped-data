## About the website

[Scotch & Soda](https://www.scotch-soda.com/) is an Amsterdam-based international fashion brand offering an eclectic mix of richly detailed, high quality, and contemporary clothing. Founded in 1985, the company emerged from a quaint boutique in Amsterdam, while its clothing is now carried in more than 8,000 outlets across 70 countries.

The evolution and rapid expansion of the company are intricately described on the [Scotch & Soda Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch_%26_Soda_(clothing)). Bloomberg does not have a page dedicated to Scotch & Soda, likely due to its status as a private company.
